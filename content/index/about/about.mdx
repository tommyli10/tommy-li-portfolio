Hi, I'm Tommy. I'm a freelance fullstack engineer.

I build and design websites for people. I am also passionate about open-source technologyies and currently a contributor to Open Source Labs, where I work with a selective community of dedicated engineers with the shared mission of driving creative technological advancements through open source.

I believe great software engineers are ones who think deeply about user experience and the best code is code that you don't have to maintain.
